Despite his violent reign, he cleverly evaded conviction for years through bribery and intimidation, once even claiming he was 'just a businessman giving the people what they want.' Ironically, this legendary gangster was ultimately brought down not by murder charges, but by federal charges for income tax evasion, a relatively mundane crime for such a powerful figure.",

His influence extended far beyond racketeering, as he played a surprising role in aiding the Allied efforts during World War II by ensuring the security of New York's docks.
